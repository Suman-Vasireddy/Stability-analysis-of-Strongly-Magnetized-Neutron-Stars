# Stability-analysis-of-Strongly-Magnetized-Neutron-Stars
Magnetic fields of Neutron stars are among the highest observed in the universe. Particle physics experiments have tried to generate such strong fields but they tend to be confined to small regions, highly unstable, and decay quickly. But some of the compact objects like Neutron stars and White Dwarfs are known to hold them for very long periods and sustain their stability, although the observed Neutron Stars and White Dwarfs are not known to have fields higher than 10^15 Gauss. This project will involve simulating the Neutron stars using XNS-code and python libraries, and the other broader questions that will be explored are

 1. Is there an upper cap to the magnetic fields these compact objects can handle, and
 2. How does the stability of such stars behave at very strong fields?
